# Why another authentication module?

The question isn't &laquo;&nbsp;why another?&nbsp;&raquo; but rather &laquo;&nbsp;Why not?&nbsp;&raquo;

After all, there are many Linux distros, many browsers, many code editors, many car brands and models, etc. It's all about user preferences, implementations, wanted features, etc. This is the very spirit of open source, that is freely offering various choices and, hopefully, have contributors help making one's preferred choice even better!

## Key features

- Modular, you import only what you need.
- Bring your own UI
- Bring your own data

## Learn

Currently, only [Next.js with React](https://vercel.com/) is supported. Contribution welcom!
